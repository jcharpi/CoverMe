 * Configuration file for the CoverMe Next.js application. This file defines build-time

 * variables, and deployment configurations.

 * - Build optimization settings
 * - Environment variable configurations
 * - Deployment-specific settings
 * - Custom webpack configurations
 * - Plugin integrations
