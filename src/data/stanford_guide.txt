About cover letter:
The cover letter provides you with an opportunity to introduce yourself and state your objective, personalize your resume, and highlight information that addresses the needs and interests of the employer. Bear in mind that letters you write not only convey your interest and qualifications, but also give the employer an opportunity to observe your attentiveness to detail, spelling, grammar, and the overall quality of your written communication. Flaws in your letters will often be interpreted as flaws in your qualifications.

Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name,

* Briefly introduce yourself, your major, and the degree anticipated.
* Refer to a specific opening if known, or state your area of interest.

* Highlight background details that would be most relevant and compelling.
* Emphasize skills, accomplishments, and experience.

Tips:
* Resumes are only as good as the letter accompanying them. Tailor your letter to the appropriate person.
* What you write and how you write it reflects your professionalism and personality.
* In professional job searches, proper etiquette and communication procedures matter.
* A cover letter should persuade the employer to take action—ideally to invite you for an interview.
